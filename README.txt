To install this project you must satisfy a handful of dependencies. On you machine you must install
Node.js, Angular.js, and Visual Studio(Community Edtion is okay). Then to run the code you select the
 Visual Studio .sln file and open it. When in VS navigate in the terminal to the your app.js directory
 and run 'npm start'. After this, go back to VS and hit the run button and this will spawn the dev
 server that will talk to the Angular dev server created with 'npm start'.
